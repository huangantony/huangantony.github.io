## What Is the Code Review Process?

The primary goal of the code review process is to assess any new code for bugs, errors, and quality standards set by the organization. The code review process should not just consist of one-sided feedback. Therefore, an intangible benefit of the code review process is the collective team‚Äôs improved coding skills.

If you would like to initiate a code review process in your organization, you should first decide who would [review the code](https://kinsta.com/blog/free-html-editor/). If you belong to a small team, you may assign team leads to review all code. In a larger team size with multiple reviewers, you could enable a process in which every code review is assigned to an experienced developer based on their workload.

The next consideration for you is to decide on timelines, rounds, and minimal requirements for submitting code review requests.

The final consideration is about how feedback should be given in the code review process. Make sure you highlight the positive aspects of the code while suggesting alternatives for drawbacks.

[Your feedback](https://kinsta.com/blog/wp-feedback-wordpress-plugin/) should be constructive enough to encourage the developer to understand your perspective and initiate a conversation when necessary.

<img src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/coding-review-process-scaled-1.jpg" alt="Code Review Process" style="zoom: 25%;" />

Keep your feedback informative

It is easy for code reviews to get stuck in limbo, leading to being less efficient and even counter-productive.

## Why Is Code Review Critical?

The code review process is critical because it is never a part of the formal curriculum in schools. You may learn the nuances of a [programming language](https://kinsta.com/blog/php-tutorials/) and [project management](https://kinsta.com/blog/trello-vs-asana/), but code review is a process that evolves as an organization ages.

Code review is critical for the following reasons:

- Ensure that you have no bugs in code.
- Minimize your chances of having issues.
- Confirm new code adheres to guidelines.
- Increase the efficiency of new code.

Code reviews further lead to improving other team members‚Äô expertise. As a [senior developer](https://kinsta.com/blog/hire-wordpress-developer/) typically conducts a code review, a junior developer may use this feedback to improve their own coding.

## How to Perform a Code Review?

There are four ways to conduct code reviews.

### Over-the-Shoulder Code Reviews

Over-the-shoulder code reviews are done on the developer‚Äôs workstation, where an experienced team member walks through the new code, providing suggestions through a conversation. It is the easiest approach to code reviews and does not require a pre-defined structure.

Such a code review may still be done informally today, along with a formal code review process that may be in place. Over-the-shoulder code reviews were traditionally done in person, while [distributed teams](https://kinsta.com/blog/working-remotely/) can follow this method through [collaborative tools](https://kinsta.com/blog/saas-products/) as well.

### Email Pass-Around

While over-the-shoulder code reviews are a great way to review new code, geographically distributed teams have traditionally relied on email for code reviews.

In this code review process, a developer emails a diff of changes to the whole development team, usually through [version control systems](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-version-control/) that automate notifications. This email initiates a conversation on the changes, where team members may request further changes, point out errors, or ask for clarifications.

<img src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/email-review-1.png" alt="Email Pass Around" style="zoom:25%;" />

Email Pass Around through Google Groups on each new push

In the early days, email was the primary means of communication because of [Its versatility](https://kinsta.com/blog/gmail-add-ons/) Open source organizations often maintained a public mailing list, which would also serve as a medium to discuss and provide feedback on code.

With the advent of code review tools, these mailing lists still exist, but primarily for announcements and discussion onward.

### Pair Programming

<img src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/in-person-code-review-scaled-1.jpg" alt="Pair Programming " style="zoom: 25%;" />

Pair Programming can be inefficient sometimes

Pair programming is a continuous code review process. Two developers sit at a workstation, but only [one of them actively codes](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/edit-wordpress-code/) whereas the other provides real-time feedback.

While it may serve as a great tool to inspect new code and train developers, it could potentially prove to be inefficient due to its time-consuming nature. This process locks down the reviewer from doing any other productive work during the period.

### Tool-Assisted

A tool-assisted code review process involves the use of a specialized tool to facilitate the process of code review. A tool generally helps you with the following tasks:

- Organize and display the updated files in a change.
- Facilitate a conversation between reviewers and developers.
- Assess the efficacy of the code review process with metrics.

While these are the broad requirements of a code review tool, modern tools may provide a handful of other functions. We‚Äôll explore a range of code review tools later in this post.

## Why Should You Use Code Review Tools?

The main outcome of a code review process is to increase efficiency. While these traditional methods of code review have worked in the past, **you may be losing efficiency if you haven‚Äôt switched to a code review tool**. A code review tool automates the process of code review so that a reviewer solely focuses on the code.

A code review tool integrates with your development cycle to initiate a code review before new code is merged into the main codebase. You can choose a tool that is compatible with your technology stack to seamlessly integrate it into your workflow.

For instance, if you use [Git for code management](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/git-vs-github/), TravisCI for continuous integration, ensure that you select a tool that supports these technologies to be able to fit into the development process.

There are two types of code testing in software development: dynamic and static.

Dynamic analysis involves checking if the code follows a set of rules and running unit tests, typically performed by a predefined script. Static code testing is done after a developer creates a new code to be merged into the current code.

Now let‚Äôs dive in some of the most popular code review tools!

Similar to Review Board, Crucible supports a large number of version control systems ‚Äî SVN, Git, Mercurial, CVS, and Perforce. Its primary function is to enable you to perform code reviews. In addition to overall comments on the code, it allows you to comment inline within the diff view to pinpoint exactly what you‚Äôre referring to specifically.

Crucible integrates well with Atlassian‚Äôs other enterprise products like Confluence and Enterprise [BitBucket](https://kinsta.com/blog/bitbucket-vs-github/). However, you will possibly get the most benefits from Crucible by using it alongside [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), Atlassian‚Äôs Issue, and Project Tracker. It allows you to perform pre-commit reviews and audits on merged code.

### 3. GitHub

If you use [GitHub](https://github.com/features/code-review/) to maintain your Git repositories on the cloud, you may have already used forks and pull requests to review code. In case you have no idea of what GitHub is, here‚Äôs a [beginner‚Äôs guide to GitHub](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/) and [the differences between Git and GitHub](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/git-vs-github/).

<img src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/github-pull-request-review-1.png" alt="Code review tools: GitHub Code Review Tool within a Pull Request" style="zoom: 25%;" />

GitHub Code Review Tool within a Pull Request

GitHub has an inbuilt [code review tool](https://github.com/features/code-review/) in its pull requests. The code review tool is bundled with GitHub‚Äôs core service, which provides [a free plan](https://github.com/pricing) for developers. GitHub‚Äôs free plan limits the number of users to three in private repositories. Paid plans start at $7 per month.

GitHub allows a reviewer with access to the code repository to assign themselves to the pull request and complete a review. A developer who has submitted the pull request may also request a review from an administrator.

In addition to the discussion on the overall pull request, you are able to analyze the diff, comment inline, and check the history of changes. The code review tool also allows you to resolve simple Git conflicts through the web interface. GitHub even allows you to integrate with [additional review tools](https://github.com/marketplace/category/code-review) through its marketplace to create a more robust process.

The GitHub code review tool is a great tool if you are already on the platform. It does not require any additional installation or configuration. The primary issue with the GitHub code review tool is that it supports only Git repositories hosted on GitHub. If you are looking for a similar code review tool that you can download and host on your server, you can [try GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/install/).

### 4. Phabricator

[Phabricator](https://www.phacility.com/phabricator/) is a list of [open source tools](https://github.com/phacility/phabricator) by Phacility that assist you in reviewing code. While you can download and install the suite of code review tools on your server, Phacility also provides a cloud-hosted version of Phabricator.

You have no limitations if you install it on your server. However, you‚Äôll be charged $20 per user per month (with an upper cap of $1000/month), which includes support. To give it a try, you can opt for a 30-day free trial.

<img src="https://kinsta.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/phabricator-review-2.png" alt="Code review tools: Core review tools: Phabricator" style="zoom: 25%;" />

Phabricator

Phabricator supports the three most popular [version control systems](https://kinsta.com/blog/wordpress-version-control/) ‚Äî Git, Mercurial, and SVN. It can manage local repositories, as well as track externally hosted repositories. You can scale it to multiple servers too.

#### Beyond a Traditional Code Review Tool

Phabricator provides a detailed platform to have a conversation with your team members. You can either have a pre-commit review of a new team member or conduct a review on the newly submitted code. You can conduct a review on merged code too, a process that Phabricator calls as ‚Äúaudit‚Äù. Here‚Äôs [a comparison between a review and an audit](https://secure.phabricator.com/book/phabricator/article/reviews_vs_audit/) on Phabricator.

Phabricator‚Äôs additional tools help you in the overall software development cycle. For instance, it provides you with a built-in tracker to manage bugs and features. You can also [create a wiki](https://kinsta.com/blog/why-use-wordpress/#3-knowledgebaseencyclopediawiki) for your software within the tool through [Phriction](https://www.phacility.com/phabricator/phriction/). To integrate the tool with unit tests, you may use Phabricator‚Äôs [CLI tool](https://www.phacility.com/phabricator/arcanist/). You can build applications over Phabricator through its API as well.

In summary, Phabricator provides you with a ton of features that help you in making your development process more efficient. It makes complete sense to opt for this tool if your project is in an early stage. If you do not have the expertise to set it up on your server, you should opt for the hosted version of the tool.
